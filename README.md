## Installation
You will not need to install any packages for this app if you a visiting the deployed link

However, if you wish to use try the app on your localhost, you will need to follow the following instructions:
Run `npm init -y` to initialise the `package.json ` and then install the following list of dependencies:

* `npm i mysql2`
* `npm i express`
* `npm i sequelize`
* `npm i express-session`
* `npm i connect-session-sequelize`
* `npm i connect-session-sequelize`
* `npm i rater-js`
* `npm i browserify`
* `npm i masonry`
* `npm i dotenv`: to make sure sensitive information i.e. password is hidden. 

The sequelize package allows us to map our object syntax on our database schemas. 

The mysql2 package connects you directly to the database created in the MySQL Workbench and you will need to create the database using the schema.sql file and running the command listed.  

Once all the dependencies are installed, you can initialise the application itself by running `node server.js` in the command line
